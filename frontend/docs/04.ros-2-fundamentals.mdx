# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System 🧠 (ROS 2)

## Weeks 3-5: ROS 2 Fundamentals

### Overview
The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the nervous system of modern robotic platforms, providing the essential communication infrastructure that enables different software components to work together seamlessly. This module introduces ROS 2 as the middleware that connects perception, planning, control, and action modules in robotic systems.

### Core Concepts
1.  **Nodes**: Executable processes that perform computation (e.g., camera driver node, motor control node, perception node)
2.  **Topics**: Named buses for publish-subscribe communication between nodes (e.g., sensor data streams)
3.  **Services**: Request-response communication for synchronous operations (e.g., navigation goals)
4.  **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication for long-running tasks (e.g., trajectory execution)
5.  **Parameters**: Configuration values that can be set at runtime for dynamic system behavior
6.  **Packages**: Organizational units containing nodes, libraries, and configuration files

### Communication Architecture
-   **Middleware**: DDS (Data Distribution Service) provides the underlying communication layer
-   **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Configurable policies for reliability, durability, and latency
-   **Message Types**: Standardized formats for data exchange between nodes
-   **Launch Systems**: Tools for starting multiple nodes with specific configurations

### Essential Tools
-   **`ros2 run`**: Execute nodes from packages
-   **`ros2 topic`**: Monitor and interact with topic-based communication
-   **`ros2 service`**: Work with service-based communication
-   **`ros2 action`**: Interface with action-based communication
-   **`colcon build`**: Build ROS 2 packages
-   **`rviz2`**: Visualization tool for robot state and sensor data
-   **`rqt`**: Graphical user interface for monitoring and controlling ROS 2 systems

### ROS 2 Ecosystem
-   **Navigation Stack**: ROS 2 Navigation2 for autonomous navigation
-   **Manipulation**: MoveIt2 for robotic manipulation planning
-   **Simulation**: Gazebo integration for testing and development
-   **Hardware Abstraction**: ros2_control for standardizing hardware interfaces

### Best Practices
-   **Modularity**: Design nodes with single responsibilities
-   **Interfaces**: Clearly define message types and service interfaces
-   **Configuration**: Use parameters for runtime customization
-   **Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests
-   **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for nodes and interfaces
