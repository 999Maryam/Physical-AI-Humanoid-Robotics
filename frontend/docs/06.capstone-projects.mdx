# Capstone

This capstone chapter integrates the concepts learned throughout the textbook to build a simple, end-to-end AI-robot pipeline. It demonstrates how different components—from perception and reasoning to action—work together in a practical application.

## Project Overview

The goal of this capstone project is to create a robot system that can perform a basic task, such as identifying a specific object and moving it to a designated location, using a combination of vision, basic AI reasoning, and robotic control.

## Architecture

1.  **Perception Module**: Utilizes a camera sensor (simulated or real) and a simple object detection algorithm (e.g., color-based detection, basic machine learning model) to locate the target object.
2.  **Reasoning Module**: A simple state machine or rule-based AI determines the next action based on the perceived environment and the task goal (e.g., "if object detected, move to grasp; if object grasped, move to drop-off location").
3.  **Manipulation Module**: Commands a robotic arm to execute grasping and placement actions. This involves inverse kinematics for reaching target poses and basic gripper control.
4.  **Communication**: ROS 2 will be used as the middleware to facilitate communication between the perception, reasoning, and manipulation nodes.

## Implementation Steps

-   **Set up Simulation Environment**: Use Gazebo or Isaac Sim to create a virtual environment with a robot arm and target objects.
-   **Integrate Camera and Object Detection**: Develop or integrate a module for visual perception and object localization.
-   **Develop Robotic Control**: Implement basic control for the robot arm, including inverse kinematics and gripper control.
-   **Create ROS 2 Nodes**: Package perception, reasoning, and manipulation logic into separate ROS 2 nodes.
-   **Define ROS 2 Topics/Services**: Establish communication channels for data exchange between nodes.
-   **Develop Task Logic**: Implement the main control loop that orchestrates the robot's behavior based on the task goal.
-   **Testing and Refinement**: Thoroughly test the pipeline in simulation and debug any issues.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this capstone, you will have a practical understanding of:

-   Integrating different AI and robotics components.
-   Designing and implementing a complete robot system.
-   Troubleshooting and debugging complex robotic pipelines.
-   Applying theoretical knowledge to real-world (simulated) challenges.
