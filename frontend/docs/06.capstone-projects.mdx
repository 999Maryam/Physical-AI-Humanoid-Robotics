# Capstone Projects 🚀

## Project Focus
The capstone project represents the culmination of your Physical AI journey, integrating all concepts learned throughout the course into a comprehensive, end-to-end system. You'll build a complete pipeline that demonstrates the full stack of physical AI: from voice input and language understanding through vision-based perception to robotic action execution.

## Detailed Capstone Description
Your primary capstone project involves creating an integrated system that can:
1. **Receive voice commands** through speech recognition technology (Whisper)
2. **Process and understand** the command using LLM-based cognitive planning
3. **Perceive the environment** using vision systems and sensor data
4. **Plan and execute actions** using ROS 2 control systems
5. **Navigate and manipulate** objects in physical space

The system architecture combines state-of-the-art AI technologies with practical robotics engineering, demonstrating the complete pipeline from human intention to physical action.
