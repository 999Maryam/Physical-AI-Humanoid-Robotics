# Basics of Humanoid Robotics

This chapter delves into the foundational aspects of humanoid robotics, covering their design, locomotion, manipulation, and interaction capabilities.

## Humanoid Robot Design

Humanoid robots are designed to mimic the human body's form and function, typically featuring a torso, head, two arms, and two legs. This design enables them to operate in environments built for humans.

## Locomotion

Walking is a primary mode of locomotion for humanoid robots. Key challenges include maintaining balance (dynamic stability) and achieving efficient, natural gaits. Advanced control algorithms are crucial for robust bipedal locomotion.

## Manipulation

Humanoid robots use arms and hands to interact with objects. This involves:

-   **Grasping**: Using grippers or multi-fingered hands to securely hold objects.
-   **Dexterity**: Performing fine motor skills and complex manipulations.
-   **Force Control**: Applying appropriate forces during interaction to avoid damage to objects or the robot itself.

## Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

Effective HRI is vital for humanoid robots working alongside humans. This includes:

-   **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: Understanding and generating natural language.
-   **Gesture Recognition**: Interpreting human body language.
-   **Safety and Collaboration**: Designing robots that can safely and effectively cooperate with humans in shared workspaces.

## Actuation and Sensors

-   **Actuators**: Motors (e.g., servo motors, series elastic actuators) provide motion.
-   **Sensors**: Proprioceptive (e.g., encoders, IMUs for joint angles, orientation) and Exteroceptive (e.g., cameras, lidar, force sensors for external environment) sensors are used for perception and control.
