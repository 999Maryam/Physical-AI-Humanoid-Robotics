# Introduction to Physical AI

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI, exploring how artificial intelligence can be embodied in physical systems to interact with the real world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the integration of AI capabilities with robotic or other physical systems, enabling them to perceive, reason, and act in dynamic environments. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI focuses on tangible interaction and manipulation.

## Key Components

1.  **Sensing**: Gathering information from the environment (e.g., cameras, lidar, force sensors).
2.  **Perception**: Interpreting sensor data to understand the environment and objects within it.
3.  **Reasoning/Decision-making**: Using AI algorithms (e.g., machine learning, planning) to determine appropriate actions.
4.  **Actuation**: Executing physical movements or manipulations (e.g., robotic arms, mobile platforms).

## Applications

-   Autonomous Vehicles
-   Humanoid Robotics
-   Industrial Automation
-   Healthcare Robotics

## Challenges

-   **Safety**: Ensuring physical systems operate safely around humans.
-   **Robustness**: Handling uncertainties and unpredictable real-world conditions.
-   **Human-Robot Interaction**: Designing intuitive and effective collaboration between humans and AI-powered physical systems.
