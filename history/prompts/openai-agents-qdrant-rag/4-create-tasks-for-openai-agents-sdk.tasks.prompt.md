## Prompt Text

$ARGUMENTS

## Response Text

Created comprehensive tasks.md for OpenAI Agents SDK with Qdrant RAG Integration. The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing:

Phase 1: Setup - Project initialization and basic structure
Phase 2: Foundational - Core infrastructure that blocks all user stories
Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1) - Core RAG Query Processing (MVP)
Phase 4: User Story 2 (P2) - Vector Database Integration
Phase 5: User Story 3 (P3) - Grounded Response Generation
Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

Each task follows the required format with ID, parallel marker [P] where applicable, user story marker [US1/US2/US3] for traceability, and specific file paths. The tasks enable both sequential delivery (MVP approach) and parallel team development strategies.

## Outcome

Tasks successfully created with 55 individual tasks organized across 6 phases. Each user story can be implemented and tested independently, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.
